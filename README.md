# Vulos CTF Challenge Walkthrough

# Overview
In this write-up, I will be discussing my approach to solving the Vulos CTF challenge, which was based on network security. The challenge was given by my college, and I will explain the steps I took to solve it, including the tools and techniques I used along the way.

# Steps
1. First, I googled the VM IP address, which was 192.168.56.3. It led me to an Apache server page, and upon inspecting the page, I found the username "TEST".

2. Next, I did an NMAP scan against 192.168.56.3 and found that SSH was running on port 22. However, when I tried connecting through SSH, I received a connection refused error. So, I scanned for all the ports, and I found Port 13652 was running.

3. I tried to connect through SSH on port 13652, and it responded. Now, the quest for SSH password began. I ran a brute force attack with the help of Metasploit, and I found the password.

4. I successfully got inside the machine, and I transferred the cap.pcapng file from the SSH server to my machine. Then, I analyzed it in Wireshark.

5. On analysis, I found an FTP packet, and on the following packet, I found the ROOT password.

6. Now, I had the user "root" and password "5gr3ss9hvvc68mT66". After logging in as root, I found the flag in s3cr3t.txt. üòä

# Tools Used
Throughout the challenge, I used the following tools and techniques:
  * NMAP: for scanning the ports
  * Metasploit: for running a brute force attack
  * Wireshark: for analyzing the cap.pcapng file
  
  
# Conclusion
 In conclusion, the Vulos CTF challenge was an interesting exercise in network security.
